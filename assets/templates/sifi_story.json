The skies are often filled with luminous clouds, dazzling sunsets, or star-filled nights, rendered with a glowing, almost ethereal quality. Urban landscapes and rural scenery are meticulously illustrated, with attention to tiny details like reflections in puddles, neon lights, or the texture of grass swaying in the wind. Characters are drawn with soft, expressive features, standing out against the breathtaking environments, creating a sense of emotional depth and lyrical atmosphere. The overall mood is cinematic, romantic, and filled with a sense of fleeting beauty and longing.</style>",
